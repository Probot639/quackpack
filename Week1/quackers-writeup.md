## What is a Rubber Ducky?
---
Also known as a `BadUSB`, a rubber ducky is any usb-enabled device that can emulate a Keyboard, Network card, Mouse, or Bluetooth connector, to take advantage of the USB plug and play protocol. These usually come in the form of microcontrollers with a usb attachment, letting them be plugged into any usb slot to do whatever they are programmed to do.

## How are they used?
---
- Maliciously ðŸ˜ˆ
- To run any command on a target machine
- To install malicious software
- To install backdoors that can be remotely accessed later
- To play funny discord gifs on the screen that you cannot get rid of
- To steal session tokens from websites and use them to login and steal things
- To be cringe
- To take remote access of machines
- TODO dox someone and put their address here (do not leave this in)
