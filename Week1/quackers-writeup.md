## What is a Rubber Ducky?
---
Also known as a `BadUSB`, a rubber ducky is any usb-enabled device that can emulate a Keyboard, Network card, Mouse, or Bluetooth connector, to take advantage of the USB plug and play protocol. These usually come in the form of microcontrollers with a usb attachment, letting them be plugged into any usb slot to do whatever they are programmed to do.
